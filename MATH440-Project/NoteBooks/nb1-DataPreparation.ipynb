    "## Datasets Overview\n",
    "This section lists all the datasets involved, such as:\n",
    "- Russian Losses as Documented by 3rd Party\n",
    "- Ukrainian Losses as Reported by Ukrainian State\n",
    "- [Add others as applicable]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools and Libraries\n",
    "This notebook utilizes Python libraries including pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical operations."
