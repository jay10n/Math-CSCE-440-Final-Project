    "This notebook is dedicated to preparing all datasets for subsequent analysis. The focus is on assessing, cleaning, structuring, and standardizing data to ensure consistency across analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets Overview\n",
    "This section lists all the datasets involved, such as:\n",
    "- Russian Losses as Documented by Third Party\n",
    "- Ukrainian Losses as Reported by Ukrainian State\n",
    "- [Add others as applicable]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools and Libraries\n",
    "This notebook utilizes Python libraries including pandas for data manipulation, SQLAlchemy for database interaction, and NumPy for numerical operations.\n"
